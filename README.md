# KNearestNeighbours
Going through the U of T CSC321 curriculum to learn a bit about Machine Learning - this exercise involves KNN categorization of faces and a little web scraping in Python

The assignment can be found here: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/321/proj1/

It is based on Two subsets of data "Actors" and "Actresses". The data starts as a list of actors and actresses and gives a web address with a picture of them, as well as coordinates to cut out their face.
